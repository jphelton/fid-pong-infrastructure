# AWS CodeBuild and CodeDeploy

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration / Continuous Deploy (or Delivery)

So to be a CI/CD Wep Application we need to have both build and deploy pipelines

At our day jobs our CI pipeline is built with Jenkins and our CD pipeline is built with uDeploy, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy are AWS tools for those jobs repsectively

CodeBuild:

- Jenkins equivilant (at least for our purposes)
- run tests and build artifacts

CodeDeploy

- uDeploy equivilant (again, at least for our limited purposes)
- automated deployment of code to non-prod and prod


here we will have templates to configure our deployment and configuration for the app
